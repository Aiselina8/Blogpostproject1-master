        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">florence is made with love by millie bobby brown (a.k.a. mills). mills has sat in hundreds of makeup chairs—everything she’s learned along the way has shown her that beauty is really all about loving and expressing ourselves. that’s why she named florence after her great-grandma, a woman who embraced herself and did things that made her happy all her life. florence is about defining beauty on our own terms. no rules. no struggle toward perfection. no boring beauty standards. just us, playing with how we want to look, feel, and live. florence is here to help with products that are crazy clean, super easy, and always fun. mills made florence to create better options for us and our friends. cause it’s about time that the brands we buy actually want us to be happy by just being ourselves. </p>
